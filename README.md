# Hotel_Booking_Analysis_with_Excel 
## Introduction
I conducted a thorough analysis of hotel booking data and provided valuable insights to help the company make informed decisions. 
My main responsibility is to offer actionable insights that could aid in making strategic decisions based on the analysis of the data.     
## Data Processing 
I downloaded the data set in CSV file format and imported another segment directly from the web to complete the data set. The CSV data was extracted and converted into .xlsx format. 
Microsoft Excel was used for data preparation, exploration, and visualization. The vlookup function was used to fill in the column for the country name from the CSV file scrapped from the web, 
the original data only had country codes. Other data cleaning operations such as filtering, removing duplicates, etc. were done. Pivot tables were used majorly for the analysis. 
## Questions
1. 	Scrape the web for the following columns: Country, country codes (alpha-2 and alpha-3), and Numeric into an Excel sheet and save the file as Country Codes.
2. Vlookup Country from Country Codes (Excel sheet created above) into Hotel Bookings Excel Sheet (insert the Country names in column O). 
3. Create Pivot tables to summarise your dataset by the following:
i. Hotel reservations by hotel_type, and total reservation
ii. Total reservations by Market segment; sort by largest to smallest.
iii. Trend of total reservations by reservation status by year
iv. Trend of Total reservations by customer type and by month 
v. Total reservations by Country, sorted by largest to smallest.

## Recommendations 
1. Tailor marketing efforts and incentives to attract more bookings from the majority of customer types and market segments. 
2. Analyze customer feedback and prioritize exceptional experiences to address the yearly decline in customers.
3. Focus on international markets with localized marketing efforts and services. 
4. Improve services for transient customers and offer loyalty cards to regular customers to increase bookings.
5. Optimize revenue and bookings by dedicating resources to the most successful distribution channels, such as GDS.
6. Strategize promotions for both peak and off-peak seasons based on customer line graph analysis.
